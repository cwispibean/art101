					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Evelyn Fu</p>
					<p>Sophomore, Undergraduate</p>
					<p>Art & Design: Games and Playable Media</p>
					<p>I'm a sophomore planning to major Art & Design: Games and Playable Media, with a passion for art and video games. Regarding game preferences, I mostly play multiplayer games because playing a video game by myself doesn't seem all that interesting. When I'm not drawing or playing games, you can find me attempting to do homework or sleeping, or spending time with my pet cat. On this site, I'll be posting my labs for the Introduction to Computer Programming for the Arts course, sharing the challenges, problems, and results of my projects. Outside of classwork, although I don't really reach out or talk much, I am always open to have a conversation. </p>
